# Libft
A collection of string and memory manipulation functions.

In this initial project, I delve into the fundamentals of C programming by reimplementing key functions from the standard library. From string manipulation to memory allocation, the code within reflects my understanding and mastery of these core concepts.

This project serves as a foundational milestone, marking the beginning of my educational journey at 42 School. The process of recoding these functions not only sharpens my C programming skills but also sets the stage for more complex challenges ahead.
